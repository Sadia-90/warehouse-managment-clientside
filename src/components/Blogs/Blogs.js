           <h3> When should I use nodejs and when should I use mongodb</h3>
            <p>MongoDB is the Document Oriented Database. MongoDB stores a lot of data in JSON format. MongoDB's performance is so much faster than any RDBMS. MongoDB is designed to work with Large Scale Data. MongoDB can work on multiple servers.There are 2 design patterns in programming. One is asynchronous programming and the other is synchronous programming. Node JS by default follows the Asynchronous pattern. That is, it does not wait for a task to be completed. In the meantime, NodeJS started another job. Thats why we use nodeJS</p>

SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.</p>
